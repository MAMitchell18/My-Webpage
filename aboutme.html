	My name is Marty Mitchell and I am attending Damien High School in La Verne, CA as a Senior. I have had a great interest in
	computers ever since I was about 8. When my parents bought a home computer, everyone was excited, especially me. I would
	always go on the computer and customize the whole desktop and the taskbar and the border colors of open programs, and 
	whenever there was a problem with the computer or my parents needed help with something on the computer, I would always
	be the one trying to figure out how I can solve it and ultimately I would always fix the problem. When I got to sophomore
	year of high school, I decided to take the Intro to Computer Science and Game Development class because I wanted to see if
	this was the type of job I would be interested in the future since I had so much fun with computers. At the end of the year,
	I knew what I wanted to do for my career. Computer Science. Then in Junior year, I had fun taking AP Computer Science
	and I also had a fun time buying all the necessary parts to build my own computer, which I use today for school and gaming.
	Now I am in my Senior year taking yet another computer science class: AP Computer Science Principles and plan on attending
	college for four years to receive a B.S. in Computer Science.</td>
