	<b>Note: </b> Clicking on the images of the components will bring you to pcpartpicker, a computer component website, 
	that allows you to compare all the different options you have for that component when building the computer, and how

	<b>CPU: </b>The first part to pick to start a PC build is the CPU, or Central Processing Unit. This is the computer 
	component that's responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from the computer's other hardware 
	and software. There are two processer brands, AMD and Intel. Intel has been known for making the better processors, 
	while AMD hasn't been as popular until they released their new line of processors this year. One of the most popular 
	lineups of processors are the Intel Core i5 series processors, since they can handle PC gaming and have great 
	performance when multitasking.

	<b>Motherboard: </b>The next part to pick for building a computer is the motherboard. The motherboard holds and allows 
	communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) 
	and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. In other words, it is another major part of the computer 
	and is required when building a PC. When picking a motherboard you must make sure that you have the right socket type so 
	that your processor fits into the motherboard correctly. Also, there are many different chipsets of motherboards that 
	can fit your CPU, some are better than others. There are many manufacturers of motherboards such as MSI, Gigabyte, and 
	Asus just to name a few, but they all are of great quality so you can't go wrong picking any motherboard brand.

	<b>RAM: </b>The next part needed to build a computer is Random Access Memory, or just memory for short. Memory is a 
	form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a 
	system. There are different speeds of RAM (2400Mhz, 2666Mhz, 3200 Mhz) and different types such as DDR4(current), DDR3, DDR2,
	and DDR. When building a computer you must check that you have the right type of ram or your computer will not work
	because the motherboard will not be able to communicate with it. However when it comes to speeds, the speeds do not
	really matter as the higher ones will make little to no difference in computer performance. There are many different 
	manufacturers of memory but they all are of great quality.

	<b>Power Supply Unit: </b>The part that will give all your components power is the power supply unit. It is very 
	important to research power supplies because you need to buy one that will provide enough power and if you want one
	that is modular, which means that you can plug in only the wires you need instead of having all the wires built in
	to the supply, which saves a lot of space and makes the build easier to assemble. Another factor to consider is the 
	rating of the PSU. They are rated as one of these: none, 80+, 80+ bronze, 80+ silver, 80+ gold, or 80+ platinum. The
	better the rating, the lower your chances are of your PSU going kapoops.

	<b>Storage: </b>The next part you need to consider is the storage sapce for your computer. As you can see, I have
	three images for this part, and that is because you have three completely different options for storage space. The 
	first option, and the first image, is a hard drive. The hard drive can be considered old technology and the slowest 
	option, although it is cheap and offers huge amounts of storage. The next option is the SSD, or solid state drive. The
	SSD is much faster, smaller, and lighter than a hard drive, so it has a lot going for it, except that it is going to
	cost quite a bit more out of pocket. The last option is the M.2 SSD. This is the newest storage technology and is 
	obviously the fastest. You have to buy a newer motherboard that supports it, and also has the highest price point out
	of all three options.

	<b>Case: </b>Next up on the parts list is the computer case. This is a very important component because the case keeps
	the outside elements, outside. This protects all of the computer components from a harsh environment so that it can 
	function properly. When picking out a case, be sure to buy a well known brand because there will be a quality difference
	when comparing to a lesser known brand. Some other things to consider are whether you want a cd drive slot, built in 
	lighting, and SSD bays.

	<td> <p>
	<b>GPU (Not Required but Recommended): </b>The last part to be considered when building a computer is the GPU, or
	graphics processing unit. The GPU is not required since the CPU has integrated graphics, although not as high
	performing as a seperate graphics processing unit. A GPU is recommended if you plan on gaming on your computer, or if
	you work a lot with 3D modeling and photography. There are lots of options when it comes to picking a graphics card. 
	There are two manufacturers of graphics cards, NVIDIA and AMD. Once again, AMD's graphics cards aren't as high performing
	as NVIDIA's. Both of these brands make many different types of graphics cards so that way you can buy the one with the
	right price. Obviously though, you get what you pay for, so if you buy their lower end cards it won't perform as good
	as one that costs more. Although these are the only two manufacturers, you will see that well known brands 
	such as MSI, EVGA, and Gigabyte sell their own versions of these graphics cards. This is because these brands take an 
	NVIDIA card or AMD card, and modify it with better cooling properties and overclock the cards so that they perform 
	better than the stock NVIDIA cards, so try not to buy the stock cards.
